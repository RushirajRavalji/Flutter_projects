              "Again, the woodcutter replied, 'No, mine was just a simple wooden axe.'\n\n"
              "For the third time, the fairy went into the river and brought out the woodcutterâ€™s real wooden axe. 'Is this the one?' she asked.\n\n"
              "The woodcutterâ€™s face lit up, 'Yes! That is my axe!'\n\n"
