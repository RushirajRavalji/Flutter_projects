              "But something went wrong! A strong wind blew, and Pip lost his balance. He fell from the nest, flapping his wings desperately. "
              "Sammy gasped as he watched his friend plummet toward the ground.\n\n"
              "Without thinking, Sammy raced up the tree. His tiny paws trembled as he climbed higher than he ever had before. "
              "The branches swayed, and his heart pounded, but he kept going‚Äîbecause his friend needed him.\n\n"
              "Just as Pip was about to hit the ground, Sammy leaped forward and caught him!\n\n"
              "The other animals cheered as Sammy carefully carried Pip back up to the nest. "
              "For the first time in his life, Sammy wasn‚Äôt afraid of heights anymore. He had discovered that "
              "courage is not the absence of fear but the strength to face it.\n\n"
              "From that day on, Sammy climbed trees like a true squirrel, never letting fear hold him back again!",
